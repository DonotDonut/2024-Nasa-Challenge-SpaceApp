# Connecting Github to VSC
1) **Download and Install Anaconda:** Visit the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and download the installer for your specific operating system.
2) **Install Anaconda:** During installation, keep everything set to the default settings.
3) **Install Jupyter and Visual Studio Code via Anaconda Navigator:**
    * Jupyter is useful for running small amounts of code.
    * Visual Studio Code is ideal for larger projects.
4) **Create a Folder:** Set up a folder to store the project code.
5) **Source Control in Visual Studio Code:**
    * Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the **Source Control** tab.
    * Select **Clone Repository** and enter the GitHub URL for the repository.
6) **Select a Folder for GitHub Code:** Choose the folder where you want to store the cloned GitHub repository.
7) **Open the Folder in Visual Studio Code:** In Visual Studio Code, go to **File â†’ Open Folder**, and select the folder where the GitHub code was saved.


# To Edit the Github Code in visual Studio Code 
1) **Open Anaconda and Launch VScode**
2) Open a termainal in viual studio code and install streamlit and astroquery 
    * to install astroquery type `pip install astroquery`
    * to install astroquery type `pip install streamlit`
9) **Run the Code:** Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and type `streamlit run .\app.py` to execute the code.

# To Edit the Github Code in Jupyter 
1) **Open Anaconda and Launch  Jupyter**
2) Open a termainal in viual studio code and install streamlit and astroquery 
    * to install astroquery type `pip install astroquery`
    * to install astroquery type `pip install streamlit`
9) **Run the Code:** Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and type `streamlit run .\app.py` to execute the code.

# Jupyter notebook way: 
- anaconda> Jupyter notebook> go to your directory for space apps
- open the python file (with .py) or both if you want
- open the terminal while in the directory in jupyter notebook. 
- pip install the required packages those arent in anaconda though terminal
- once the code is good try running the app/code

- also .ipynb is a better way to check every steps of coding. Highly recommend to use jupyter notebook
